## ðŸ“˜ Selenium TestNG Automation Project â€“ Technical Documentation

---

### ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

This project showcases the design and implementation of a functional UI automation suite for a web-based enterprise application using **Selenium WebDriver**, **TestNG**, and **Java**. The automation suite targets validation of user interface elements, workflows, and business logic within the Mendix UI module.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Technologies & Tools

* **Language:** Java
* **Automation Tool:** Selenium WebDriver
* **Test Framework:** TestNG
* **IDE:** Eclipse
* **Browser Driver:** ChromeDriver
* **Version Control:** Git (used locally)

---

### ðŸ”¹ Key Test Scenarios

* Validation of **entire web elements and functionalities** across various modules
* Login screen testing with input field interaction
* Presence and behavior verification for labels, buttons, icons, and tooltips
* Page navigation and dynamic content validation
* Report section testing including filters and sorting elements
* UI behavior under positive/negative test conditions
* Assertions for element visibility, correctness, and responsiveness

---

### ðŸ”¹ Test Design & Structure

* Structured using **TestNG annotations**:

  * `@BeforeMethod` â€“ Sets up browser and environment
  * `@Test` â€“ Executes test scenarios
  * `@AfterMethod` â€“ Closes browser and handles cleanup
* Uses **explicit waits** to synchronize tests with dynamic UI behavior
* Organized test logic for reusability and scalability

### ðŸ”¹ Responsibilities & Contributions

* Designed automated tests for validating UI workflows and controls
* Implemented wait strategies to ensure reliable execution
* Modularized test logic for better maintainability
* Conducted exploratory testing and logged findings for development review
* Collaborated in identifying functional gaps and UI inconsistencies

---

### ðŸ”¹ What I Learned

* Building robust automation test scripts from scratch using Selenium and TestNG
* Managing element synchronization using wait strategies (e.g., WebDriverWait)
* Structuring tests for scalability and ease of maintenance
* Applying assertion techniques for both UI presence and functional correctness
* Debugging locator issues and dynamic elements
* Understanding of test execution lifecycle using TestNG
* Improving cross-functional collaboration with QA and development teams
