## ðŸ“˜ Selenium TestNG Automation Project â€“ Technical Documentation

---

### ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

This project demonstrates the development of a modular UI automation framework for validating a web-based enterprise application. It leverages **Selenium WebDriver**, **TestNG**, **Java**, and integrates backend interaction using **JDBC** for data-driven validations. The project also incorporates **XML-based configuration** for test suite execution and environment settings.

### ðŸ”¹ Technologies & Tools

* **Language:** Java
* **Automation Tool:** Selenium WebDriver
* **Test Framework:** TestNG
* **Database Access:** JDBC
* **Configuration Format:** testng.xml & custom XML for DB parameters
* **IDE:** Eclipse
* **Browser Driver:** ChromeDriver
* **Version Control:** Git (used locally)

---

### ðŸ”¹ Key Test Scenarios

* Validation of **entire web elements and functionalities** across modules
* Login page testing and credential form validation
* Element presence and behavior checks for labels, buttons, tooltips
* Navigation testing for dashboard and report modules
* Integration with backend database via **JDBC** for verifying UI and data consistency
* Dynamic content and filter/sorting validation
* Assertions for expected UI state and content behavior

---

### ðŸ”¹ Test Design & Structure

* Uses **TestNG annotations**:

  * `@BeforeMethod` â€“ Initializes WebDriver, reads XML config
  * `@Test` â€“ Contains actual UI and data validation test logic
  * `@AfterMethod` â€“ Handles browser closure and cleanup
* Employs **explicit waits** for stable element interaction
* XML configuration (`testng.xml`) manages test groups, classes, and parallel execution
* **Database connection strings** and credentials are maintained in an external XML file (e.g., `db-config.xml`)

### ðŸ”¹ Database Integration

* JDBC is used for connecting to backend systems to validate data shown on the UI.
* Sample (non-sensitive) structure of JDBC connection logic:

  ```java
  Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(DB_URL, USERNAME, PASSWORD);
  ```
* The database URL and credentials are externalized in `db-config.xml` for flexibility and separation of concerns.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Responsibilities & Contributions

* Implemented automated test logic covering both UI and backend verification
* Managed configuration through external XML files for maintainability
* Integrated JDBC logic to validate data accuracy behind reports and forms
* Applied synchronization strategies and dynamic element handling
* Structured reusable methods to support test scalability

---

### ðŸ”¹ What I Learned

* Advanced use of **Selenium WebDriver** and **TestNG** for test organization
* Constructing **JDBC connections** and executing SQL queries within test flows
* Maintaining test flexibility through **external XML configuration**
* Writing clean, maintainable code that separates logic from configuration
* Debugging browser interaction and database result mismatches
* Collaborating with cross-functional teams to ensure test completeness
